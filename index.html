            <h3>Eden of Mars</h3>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>The game revolves around managing a settlement where the wellbeing and mood of settlers play a pivotal role.The settlement's sustainability depends on the player's ability to ensure the settlers' moods remain positive. If settlers' moods decline, they may become ill, and a cascading effect will ensue if the mood index reaches zero.</p>
            <p>One core feature of the game is the 'Mood Mechanic': depending on the collective mood, the game will generate challenges aligned with it. For instance, if the mood is low, challenges may involve restoring it by producing enough food containing essential vitamins.</p>
            <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Unity: For game development and building the game's core mechanics.</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>ChatGPT 3.5 (intended for later stages): Planned to be used for more dynamic and personalized challenge generation, rather than a hardcoded condition chain.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Challenge Generation:</strong> Creating a system where challenges adjust based on settlers' mood without being too repetitive or predictable.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> Exploring the potential of integrating ChatGPT for personalized challenges and facing initial hurdles in setting up the API integration in Unity.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> Balancing between feature-rich content and the urgency to make the game playable as soon as possible. The developer decided to postpone the AI integration to a later stage to prioritize the game's core mechanics and playability.</li>
            </ul>
